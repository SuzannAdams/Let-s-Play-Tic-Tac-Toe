# Feedback

Congrats on satisfying the project requirements! Here's some feedback for you:

## Code Quality

Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

- Make sure to remove any unneeded code (e.g., console.log) from your HTML/JS/CSS files!
- Typically, code comment should be added before, not after the code.
- The `disableListener()` and `showMessage()` can be moved outside of the conditional logic because they are common to all of the conditions.

## Technical Requirements

Renders in browser with no major errors and seperates concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

- In general, I'd not recommend using tag selectors (e.g., h1, td, table, button, main) to target elements for styling because they are not specific enough and can easily get overridden. Use class selectors instead.

## Creativity and Interface

The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

- Your game looks really good in the browser! Design is simple and eye-catching. I thought the overall design was really neat!

## Presentation

Application has functional and creative interface and a readme with relevant information about the application.

- Your readme is also informative! I thought the format made a lot of sense and was easy to understand.

## Additional Feedback

- Take a look at some of my inline comments on your code.
- Work on making your commit messages more descriptive. Take a look at this resource on how to write good commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
- Overall, it was an enjoyable game to play!
